* Build up your persona in the community as a contributing member
* Stay up to date on the active discussions in the community

Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
=========================
While working with OpenStack, IRC is the best way to get real time help
or support others. Details of how to get on IRC, channel lists, how meetings
are run, where to find logs, and our IRC bots are described in
:ref:`setup-irc`.

.. note::
   Depending on what time zone you are based in there might be more traffic
   on some channels than others. Have a little patience when waiting for
   people to respond.

Wiki Pages
==========

Each project and working group has its own `wiki page
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Main_Page>`__.
Wiki pages are a secondary source of information. They hold information that is
subject to more change than the info provided in the project's documentation
i.e. meeting agendas, team members, etc.

Etherpads and Ethercalcs
========================

Etherpad is a simple collaborative text editor. It is used as a common place to
have people in a project collaborate on larger projects and planning of events.
There is no master list of etherpads - it is harder to find what you are
looking for without having looked at it before or without asking for the URL.
It is recommended to bookmark the important etherpads for later reference.
The starting page of the OpenStack Etherpad is `this
<https://etherpad.openstack.org>`_.

Ethercalc is a simple collaborative spreadsheet. It works in a similar way as
Etherpad, but it is more useful to facilitate distributed booking or
scheduling of resources. The starting page of OpenStack Ethercalc is `here
<https://ethercalc.openstack.org/>`_.

Mailing Lists (ML)
==================

There are more than 40 different ML's. These are listed in the `mailman page
<http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo>`__.
Mailing lists are a way for people to communicate to a larger group than those
that are on IRC. All emails on these lists are archived and available on the
`Mailing Lists <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mailing_Lists>`_ wiki.
The same page describes how to subscribe to a list and describes some popular
lists.

ask.openstack.org
=================

`Ask OpenStack <https://ask.openstack.org/>`__ is a question and answer site
for OpenStack users and developers. It provides answer to almost every
question a new contributor can run into. It is possible to collect karma points
by asking or answering questions. The questions are moderated by Ask OpenStack
users with high Karma points. More info about Ask OpenStack is available on
its `about page <https://ask.openstack.org/en/about/>`__ and on the `ask
moderators wiki <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Community/AskModerators>`__.
