Setup Your Task Tracker Account
===============================

.. note::
   The OpenStack community is currently in the process of moving from the bug
   tracking software Launchpad to StoryBoard. Further in the project specific
   on-boarding documentation, give special attention to if the project is
   using Launchpad or StoryBoard. If your project is still using Launchpad
   you will want to take notice of the Launchpad section later in this
   document.

A Task Tracker account allows you to:

* Report bugs
* Create stories for new features (Process varies per project)
* Track progress on bugs and new features

Launchpad
---------

What is Launchpad?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/openstack>`_ is the legacy way the OpenStack
community does bug tracking since we started `moving towards StoryBoard
<https://superuser.openstack.org/articles/openstack-gerrit-storyboard-integration>`_.

Sign Up
^^^^^^^
You're already signed up. Launchpad uses your Ubuntu One account for
authentication like StoryBoard.
