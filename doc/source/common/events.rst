OpenStack Events
================

The OpenStack Foundation organizes multiple events per year to bring together
the community as well as companies and individuals interested in the technology
and to embrace and encourage open collaboration.

This section allows you to:

* Understand the differences between the different in-person OpenStack events
* Know which events are valuable to you

Open Infrastructure Summit
--------------------------

The `Summits <https://www.openstack.org/summit/other-summits/>`_ are bi-annual
events with thousands of attendees from all around the globe. The event in
Spring is located in North America and the Fall occasions are alternating
somewhere between Europe and Asia.

The event is designed to bring together users, operators and developers to
discuss feedback and future plans and you will also find a lot of options to
collaborate with representatives from adjacent communities.

To see how OpenStack and further OpenStack Foundation projects are utilized
you will find exhibitors at the Market Place area.

The sessions are grouped into two major parts, the conference and the Forum.

Conference
++++++++++

The conference sessions consist of 40-minute-long presentations and panel
discussions organized into tracks, like 'Public Clouds', 'Containers', or
'Telecom/NFV'.

There is a Call For Papers (CFP) process before each Summit where anyone can
propose sessions for the upcoming event. After the CFP deadline the proposals
go through a community vote after which a group of track chairs decide about
the final content for each track.

Forum
+++++

The Forum sessions are also 40 minutes long, but the sessions are intended to
be working sessions as opposed to presentations.

The purpose of the Forum is to provide space for the developer and user
community to get together and discuss feedback and find solutions to problems
and new challenges and requirements.

The Forum sessions are proposed by the community through a proposal period
and the final sessions are selected by a committee.

You can find both the conference and Forum sessions on the Summit schedule.

Project Teams Gathering (PTG)
-----------------------------

This event is created to provide space and time for developers and operators to
get together and have detailed technical discussions.

The `PTG <https://www.openstack.org/ptg/>`_ sessions are organized into
parallel tracks. The time is divided between Working Groups, SIGs,
cross-project and project team sessions and further sessions
dedicated to operations related discussions.

PTGs are scheduled at the beginning of each release cycle which makes it
possible to do more thorough release planning and ensure that the more
complicated proposals are discussed with all the affected teams.

This event is recommended to developers, operators and end users who are
already involved in community activities. If you are a new comer you might
want to consider one of the OpenStack Summits first where you can find several
sessions to help you find your way within the community.

Community-organized Events
==========================

There are community organized events all year all around the globe. Be sure
you `check <https://www.openstack.org/community/events/>`_ when the next one is
in your area!

OpenStack/OpenInfra Days
------------------------

`OpenStack Days <https://www.openstack.org/community/events/openstackdays>`_
events are similar to the Open Infrastructure Summits that are organized by
the local community, users groups and companies.

The events are one or two days long and filled with mainly presentations and
panel discussions about the latest hot topics in the community's life.
It gives you a great opportunity to meet the local community and find people
who are interested in the same challenges and technology as you are.
Connecting with people in the same region where you are gives you the
advantage to be able to reach out easier to them later as they are in the
same time zone, maybe even in the same city.

In some cases there are training sessions and workshops as well and you may see
the `OpenStack Upstream Institute
<https://docs.openstack.org/upstream-training/>`_ training on the agenda as
well.

OpenInfra Days are essentially the same in format and benefit to attendees,
but are broader in scope. OpenInfra Days are focused on being more open
and welcoming of adjacent infrastructure technologies.

Meet-ups
--------

Meet-ups are organized by local user groups with different cadences. They are a
few hours long with a few presentations, discussion topics and some snacks.

Look for `meetups in your area <http://meetup.com/pro/osf>`_  and if you
cannot find one you are welcome to organize one yourself!
