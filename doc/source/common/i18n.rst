Contribute as a Translator
##########################

If English is not your native language, you may wish to contribute as
a translator. All services and documents that are visible
to the user are translated by the I18n team. It does not matter which
language you speak. We already have a lot of language teams who are very
active. Our claim is more diversity, to support us in our work at I18n.

This section allows you to:

* Help translate OpenStack, making it more available for users worldwide

Translation Platform
====================

We use `Zanata <http://zanata.org/>`_ as the platform for translating
strings in software projects and documentation. Zanata provides web user
interfaces: you only need a web browser to start your translation
contribution. Our translation platform is reachable on
`translate.openstack.org <https://translate.openstack.org/>`_

Your membership application must be confirmed by the language
coordinator. This may take some time. An e-mail with your request will
be sent automatically.

Choose a project where you want to contribute with translating. Usually
there is a translation plan with priorities on the start page.
