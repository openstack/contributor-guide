What is the Contributor Portal?
===============================
The `Contributor Portal <https://www.openstack.org/community/>`_  provides the
community with a landing page for new contributors to discover different ways
to contribute to OpenStack.

There are different contribution categories listed, such as Code &
Documentation and Users. Each one of these has their own contributor guide
listed on the main page of the :doc:`../index`.

Experienced contributors can find helpful reference links listed here too.

Proposing a New Contribution Category
=====================================

Send your proposal to the `OpenStack Discuss List
<http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss>`_
with the email subject prefixed with [contributor-portal]. This will
start discussions on accepting the new contribution category.

Proposing a Project Team Under Code & Documentation
===================================================
The project teams listed under the 'Code & Documentation' section come from
OpenStack's governance repository `project.yaml file
<https://opendev.org/openstack/governance/src/reference/projects.yaml>`_.
This file is a list of projects that are recognized by the
`Technical Committee <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/>`_. Project teams
under this category should make sure their 'contributor' field is set to the
URL of their specific contributor guide. See the `project.yaml file
<https://opendev.org/openstack/governance/src/reference/projects.yaml>`_
file for examples.
