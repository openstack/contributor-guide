Mailing List
=============
Operators have used a dedicated mailing list until November 2018. You
can read the `openstack.operators archive
<http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-operators/>`_
which contain plenty of valuable information.
Currently there is a `joint mailing list
<http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss>`_
for developer and operator to subscribe.
More generic information about mailing lists can be found in the Communication
page's :ref:`communication-mailing-lists` section.

IRC Channels
============
There is the #openstack-operators channel on Freenode IRC for live
conversations and `Operators' team meeting
<http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/#OpenStack_OSOps_Team>`_.
On top of the #openstack-operators channel there are several others. More
generic information about IRC channels can be found in the :ref:`irc-channels`
section of the IRC page.

Meet Ups
========
`Operators' Meetups <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Operations/Meetups>`_ give
people who run clouds a place to congregate, swap best practices, ideas and
give feedback. It has a mostly round table/working/discussion session feel,
with only a small number of presentations, with the following aims:

1. Gather feedback on the issues that come up in running OpenStack and work to
   communicate this throughout the community
2. Create a forum in which to share best practices and architectures between
   interested parties
3. Increase constructive, proactive involvement from those running clouds

Share and Learn From Real Configurations
========================================
Example configurations for various OpenStack services are provided in the `openstack/osops-example-configs
repository
<https://opendev.org/x/osops-example-configs/src/README.md>`_.
Operators can share their configuration files to help others, and review how
others setup and tune their configurations.
