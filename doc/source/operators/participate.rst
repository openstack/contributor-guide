Mailing List
=============
Operators had previously used a dedicated mailing list until November 2018. You
can read the `openstack.operators archive
<http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-operators/>`_
which contains plenty of valuable information.

To unify our community, we have replaced the operator and developer
specific mailing lists with a `joint mailing list
<http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss>`_
for developers and operators to subscribe to and converse on together.

.. note::
   To get more operator attention, prepend '[ops]' to your email subject lines.

More generic information about mailing lists can be found in the Communication
page's :ref:`communication-mailing-lists` section.

IRC Channels
============
There is the #openstack-operators channel on OFTC IRC for live
conversations and `Operators' team meeting
<http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/#OpenStack_OSOps_Team>`_.
On top of the #openstack-operators channel there are many others that you
might find useful. More generic information about IRC channels can be found
in the :ref:`irc-channels` section of the IRC page.

In the :ref:`setup-irc` section of this guide, there are instructions on how
to set up a desktop client and register your irc nickname so that you can
join these channels.

Meet Ups
========
`Operators' Meetups <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Operations/Meetups>`_ give
people who run clouds a place to congregate, swap best practices, ideas and
give feedback. It has a mostly round table/working/discussion session feel,
with only a small number of presentations, with the following aims:

1. Gather feedback on the issues that come up in running OpenStack and work to
   communicate this throughout the community
2. Create a forum in which to share best practices and architectures between
   interested parties
3. Increase constructive, proactive involvement from those running clouds

There are other events relevant to operators besides just the meetup,
:ref:`events-forum` and the rest of the :ref:`summit`
