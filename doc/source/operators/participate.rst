Meet Ups
========
`Operators' Meetups <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Operations/Meetups>`_ give
people who run clouds a place to congregate, swap best practices, ideas and
give feedback. It has a mostly round table/working/discussion session feel,
with only a small number of presentations, with the following aims:

1. Gather feedback on the issues that come up in running OpenStack and work to
   communicate this throughout the community
2. Create a forum in which to share best practices and architectures between
   interested parties
3. Increase constructive, proactive involvement from those running clouds

Share and Learn From Real Configurations
========================================
Example configurations for various OpenStack services are provided in the `openstack/osops-example-configs
repository
<http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/osops-example-configs/tree/README.md>`_.
Operators can share their configuration files to help others, and review how
others setup and tune their configurations.
