Quick Start
###########

This guide is to list the minimal steps you need
to do to push your first patch in OpenStack.

Set up accounts and configure environment
-----------------------------------------

To get started, first set up required accounts.

#. OpenStack :doc:`../common/accounts`

#. :doc:`../common/git`

#. :doc:`../common/setup-gerrit`

Push your change
----------------

OpenStack uses Gerrit to propose and review the code.

* Here is a quick overview of the `Gerrit Workflow
  <https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/infra-manual/latest/developers.html#quick-reference>`_

* Push your change and review :doc:`using-gerrit`

Practice the workflow using Sandbox Project
-------------------------------------------

To make sure everything is set up correctly or to understand the workflow
without trying it on actual projects, you can practice in a Sandbox using
the :doc:`sandbox-house-rules` Guide.

For further details on contributing to the OpenStack community, please refer
to :doc:`../index`.
