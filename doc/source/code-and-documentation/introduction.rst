The heart of open source is the people who are participating in a community and
it is no different in case of OpenStack either.

This chapter will guide you through of all the tools and processes that we are
using to develop, test, maintain, and document the projects in OpenStack.

Communication is underrated, but crucial when it comes to participating in an
open source community. We have several tools that we use for online and offline
communication, which we encourage you to use.

We do not differentiate between the different types of contributions such as
code or documentation therefore you will find guidance in this chapter for all
types.

A detailed description of the documentation tools and processes can be found
in the
`OpenStack Documentation Contributor Guide <https://docs.openstack.org/doc-contrib-guide/index.html>`_.
